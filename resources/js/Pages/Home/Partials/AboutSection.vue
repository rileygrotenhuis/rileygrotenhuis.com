        I am the creator, and sole developer behind Corvesive. I currently work
        for Midwestern Interactive as a software engineer, but have a little
        over 3 years of professional experience in the industry.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white text-sm mb-4">
        I’m excited to share Corvesive with you all as it’s been my passion
        project, and has seen multiple iterations for the better part of 2
        years. I hope to make your every day budgeting needs a little bit easier
        with these solutions!
